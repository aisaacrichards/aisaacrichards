Well, hello there! This is where I keep the software I write as well as the source code for my [excellent Hugo based blog](https://allenisaacrichards.com) where I write short stories and news articles about the intersection of Artificial Intelligence, and humanity - a topic I have been immersed in since I read my first Isaac (my namesake) Asimov story, "Mirror Image".
